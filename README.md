# Auslan fingerspelling
There's a lot more to auslan than the alphabet! But, the alphabet is part of it, so if you want to learn that part, this might help.

I recommend turning the speed way down and typing each letter as it appears to start with to reduce memory strain.
But eventually, the goal is to increase the speed and watch a whole word at a time before typing it in. That's more like what you'll need in real life if you're trying to fingerspell your way out of a vocab gap.

Good luck have fun happy signing!
